# Common Consumer Grounds (Plain-English)  [SRC:consumer_rights]

- **Breach of contract**  
  You paid for something that wasn’t delivered as promised (service not performed, refund not issued, etc.).  
  - *Statute of limitations (NY):* up to **6 years** for most contract claims; **4 years** for sale-of-goods (UCC) disputes.

- **Defective product / warranty**  
  Goods must be **merchantable** (fit for ordinary purpose). You can claim **money damages** for defects.

- **Security deposit / refund owed**  
  Money held or owed should be returned **within a reasonable time** per agreement or law.

- **Chargeback (credit card)**  
  **Time-sensitive** — contact your card issuer quickly per network rules.  
  Small Claims can still pursue **money damages** from the merchant if appropriate.

- **Government defendants**  
  Often require a **Notice of Claim** (e.g., within **90 days**) before suing; special rules and deadlines apply.

### Drafting Tip  
Keep “Legal Basis” to **one line**, e.g.:  
> *“Breach of contract — non-delivery on 03/22/2025; seeking money damages.”*  

Avoid detailed legal advice.
