# Quick Answers the Assistant Can Reuse [SRC:faq]

- **Can the court make them fix/return something?**  
  No. Small Claims awards money only.

- **My claim is $12,000 – can I split it?**  
  No. Don’t split claims to fit $10,000; consider regular Civil Court.

- **How is the defendant notified?**  
  Clerk mails first-class + certified; if that fails, you arrange personal service.

- **How much is filing?**  
  $15 if ≤ $1,000; $20 if $1,000–$10,000.

- **How long to sue?**  
  Depends on claim type (e.g., 6 years for most contracts; 4 years for sale of goods).

- **They didn’t pay after judgment – now what?**  
  After roughly 30 days, you may request enforcement (e.g., NYC Sheriff; fees may apply).
